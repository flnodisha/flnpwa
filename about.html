    <h1>About FLN Odisha</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>FLN Odisha</strong> is a mobile application developed to support the <strong>Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN) Development Programme</strong> initiated by the Government of Odisha. This programme is designed to enhance the literacy and numeracy skills of children at the foundational stage, helping to build a strong educational base.
    </p>

    <h2>What is FLN?</h2>
    <p>
      Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN) refers to the ability of children to read with comprehension and perform basic mathematical operations by the time they reach the end of Grade 3. FLN is essential for ensuring that children are equipped with the skills necessary for further learning and growth in education.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features of the App</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Interactive learning modules for literacy and numeracy.</li>
      <li>Progress tracking for students and teachers.</li>
      <li>Comprehensive learning resources tailored for foundational stages.</li>
      <li>Easy-to-navigate interface designed for both teachers and students.</li>
      <li>Access to activities and games that make learning fun and engaging.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why FLN Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Studies have shown that children who do not attain foundational literacy and numeracy skills in their early years are more likely to struggle with advanced education. The FLN Odisha app aims to tackle this issue by providing quality learning materials that help children achieve the desired educational outcomes in a fun and accessible way.
    </p>

    <h2>Who is this App For?</h2>
    <p>
      The FLN Odisha app is designed for teachers, students, and parents involved in the foundational stages of education. It offers resources to improve the learning environment both in schools and at home, ensuring every child in Odisha has access to quality education.
